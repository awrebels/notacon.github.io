### Puzzlehunts for Beginners

- [Zelda minihunt](https://deusovi.github.io/puzzlefiles/zelda-minihunt.pdf) ([Deusovi](https://deusovi.github.io/)): 3 puzzles and a meta, as short and sweet as it gets.
- [Colby's Curious Cookoff](https://curiouscookoff.com/): 22 puzzles, four metas, a capstone and a metameta. Very polished; most if not all puzzles have interfaces that let you solve them directly in the browser. Pay-what-you-want.
- [DP Puzzle Hunt](https://dp.puzzlehunt.net/): 23 puzzles and two metas. Makes more effort than the other hunts on this list to follow "puzzlehunt conventions", particularly for metas, in my opinion (but I led this effort). Difficulty fluctuates a bit.
