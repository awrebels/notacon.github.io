Not all of these terms are widely attested.

Australian-style puzzlehunt

:   Loosely describes a set of puzzlehunt operating conventions in which puzzles and pre-written hints are released at fixed times each day over several days. Named after the triad of Australian puzzlehunts MUMS, SUMS, and CiSRA, which ran with peak reliability around 2010â€“2013.

Answerphrase

:   A phrase of the form, "THE ANSWER IS (answer)". A degenerate form of the cluephrase. Mentioned in David Wilson's [Introduction to Writing Good Puzzle Hunt Puzzles](https://web.mit.edu/dwilson/www/puzzles/puzzlewriting.html).

Arepo

:   One inelegant component of a construction that allows the whole thing to work. Named after the [Sator Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square).

Backsolve

:   To solve a puzzle by guessing the answer using constraints on it from the metapuzzle. The opposite is "forward-solve".

    There is a spectrum of backsolving. In the extreme case you might ignore the puzzle entirely and guess the answer simply based on how it fits into the metapuzzle. In milder cases, you might have a constraint like you know a few letters or a theme from the puzzle and also a constraint from the metapuzzle, and combine the two to find the answer.

    Puzzle and meta authors will sometimes try to design metapuzzles to prevent backsolving or make it harder, since if you backsolve a puzzle you manage to circumvent seeing the puzzle itself, which somebody probably worked really hard on.

Capstone puzzle

:   A puzzle with particular significance in terms of hunt progression or unlocking, like a metapuzzle, but that doesn't directly use meta answer.

Cluephrase

:   A phrase that suggests the final answer, or more generally just the next step in a puzzle, usually extracted from earlier information in the puzzle.

Conundrum

:   (also Konundrum, Duck Konundrum) A puzzle consisting of a sequence of detailed instructions that the solver must faithfully follow or simulate to solve the puzzle. The instructions are often unrealistic but easy to simulate, e.g. involving animals or fictional beings making complex decisions. The genre-defining example is [The Duck Konundrum](https://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2000/set5/6/Puzzle.html) from MIT Mystery Hunt.

[Ditloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditloid)

:   A type of word puzzle in which a phrase has had most of its words abbreviated, typically with common words like prepositions and articles preserved and with numbers preserved but written out as digits instead. Solvers must deduce the original phrase. For example, "24 H in a D" solves to "24 Hours in a Day".

[Dropquote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropquote)

:   A type of word puzzle where a phrase, quotation, or other series of words has been concealed in a crossword-like grid reading left to right, top to bottom, and then the letters in each column have been removed and provided in sorted order at the top.

Extraction

:   A step in a puzzle solution that condenses its information; often, but not necessarily, the final step. Typical example involves extracting one letter from each clue answer or subpuzzle and having the letters spell out the answer or a cluephrase.

Identify, Sort, Index, Solve (ISIS)

:   A loosely defined, common puzzle type consisting of those four steps in order: identifying some puzzle-provided objects or clues, sorting them in some order based on the identification, indexing by a provided number to produce a cluephrase, and using the cluephrase to solve the puzzle.

Indexing

:   To take the Nth letter from a word or phrase, or more rarely the Nth word from a sentence or just any Nth term from a sequence. A common step in extraction.

Mangled clues

:   (there isn't a consensus term; other phrases include "cluetations", "word transformers", "tortued clues") A puzzle type in which clues are typically given without spaces and where each word has been modified according to some orthographic rule, things like "change all As to Bs", "insert a Q after the second letter", "Caesar shift the last letter forward by four", or combinations thereof. Typically, the answer to the clue will then be modified by the same rule or its reverse.

Metapuzzle

:   A puzzle that uses answers from other puzzles. Typically unlocked after regular puzzles. Usually important for progressing through a hunt; the answer to a metapuzzle may have plot significance in that regard and is also often humorous or punny.

McFly

:   (v.) To forward-solve a puzzle you previously backsolved, usually after the hunt for fun.

Runaround

:   A puzzle that generally involves following instructions to move around a physical space (by running or otherwise), typically to gather information in a puzzly way.

Pure metapuzzle

:   A metapuzzle with no or minimal content (e.g. only flavortext) in and of itself; the metapuzzle consists of just the answers that feed into it. The opposite is a "shell metapuzzle".

Puzzle trail

:   (not common) A linear sequence of puzzles where each one leads to the next, often by changing a component of the URL to the answer due to the technical simplicity of implementing that. The Ur-example is notpr0n.

Shell metapuzzle

:   A metapuzzle with content (the "shell"). For example, the metapuzzle might have a crossword grid that you are supposed to put the puzzle answers, or something related, into. The opposite is a "pure metapuzzle".

Wheel of Fortune (WoF)

:   To guess answers while knowing, or having guesses for, only some of the letters and their positions. Named after the American game show.
